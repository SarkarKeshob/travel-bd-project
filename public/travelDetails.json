        "details": "The Sundarbans mangrove forest, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, lies on the delta of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna rivers on the Bay of Bengal. It is home to diverse flora and fauna, including the Royal Bengal Tiger. The Sundarbans is one of the largest mangrove forests in the world, covering an area of approximately 10,000 square kilometers across India and Bangladesh. The region is characterized by its unique ecosystem, where saltwater from the Bay of Bengal meets freshwater from the rivers, creating a dynamic environment that supports a wide range of plant and animal species. In addition to the Royal Bengal Tiger, the Sundarbans is also home to species such as the spotted deer, saltwater crocodile, and various species of birds and fish. The mangrove trees play a crucial role in protecting the coastline from erosion and storm surges, making them vital for the local communities that depend on the Sundarbans for their livelihoods.",

The first settlement started just 250 years ago by some Arabian Sailors who named the island 'Zajira'. During British occupation, the island was named 'Saint Martin's Island' after a British soldier, Captain Martin, who was killed during the First Anglo-Burmese War. The local names of the island are 'Narical Gingira', also spelled 'Narikel Jinjira/Jinjera', which means 'Coconut Island' in Bengali, and 'Daruchini Dip'. It is the only coral island in Bangladesh.",
